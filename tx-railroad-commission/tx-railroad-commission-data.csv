Email reads: Here in Houston there is a pipeline that crosses Buffalo Bayou just to the west of Wilcrest Road. It is not buried beneath the bed of the bayou, and it is not high enough above the bayou to be out of the water, so every time there is a storm, big trees and stuff hit the pipeline as they get washed downstream. It has a huge bend in it, so it looks like a 40 foot long banana between the two banks of the bayou, and it looks pretty scary. It is about 16 to 20 inches in diameter There is a pipeline lollipop nearby, and it says Netco Pipeline, and there is an old flyover marker that has a 95 on it.

But in case you did not I am attaching my comments with attachments. I will also attach my proposed rules for noise control at Oil and Gas Facilities (Atch 3). The current EPA rules for noise dated 1974 do not address Low Frequency Noise (LFN) that harms the human body systems. Each of our human body systems operate at a different low frequency. When the intensity (in decibels on the ""C"" - environmental scale) exceeds a body system's operating limits, that system is compromised. Some of the comments concerning testing at the facility site came from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules. Two attachments I could not find to attach. My home address is 609 East F.M. 489, Buffalo, Texas 75831. Even though the address is Buffalo, I live 10 miles north in the community of Lanely at the corner of F.M. 489 and County Road 441. The nearest large gas compressor station is the Dowdy Ranch Compressor Station on County Road 421 about 1/2 mile further east on F.M. 489 and turn north going 1/2 mile to the entrance of the compressor station. As the crow flies, it is 0.9 miles from my home. I have found that the Low Frequency Noise (LFN) generated at this site will travel five to eight miles in all directions. Today, the LFN intensity at my home was 75 dBC (Environmental Scale). The 1974 Environmental Protection Agency limit is 55 dBA (Hearing Range Scale). For every three decibel increase, the intensity is doubled. My Blood Pressure was 194/112. My normal BP is 120/70 when the LFN is not present. I took medication and departed immediately for a public place in Buffalo. This scenario occurs almost every day. If you can get the owner (Lone Star Gas) to limit their emissions of LFN, that would be great.",,,,2017-10-24,Other,Noise complaint,Field,,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mPEAAA2/Inspection_Packages__r,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mPEAAA2/Inspection_Documents__r

On July 22nd during the 8 o’clock hour I (Paul A. Mylnar, Member) discovered a gas leak in the pipeline right away that runs along the Northeastern edge of my property at 671 W. FM 351, Beeville, TX 78102. I called 911 immediately to notify emergency services. It was discovered to be a pipeline operated by Targa and they were notified by emergency services of the leak. A Targa representative showed up and took over the location. While inspecting my property I discovered that an oily very strong-smelling oil base type fluid had been released from the pipeline. The fluid had run for 340’ through a natural drain field extending 139’ from the pipeline easement further into my property. I notified the Targa supervisor on sight of the further affected area that I had discovered. The Targa representative and I inspected, videoed and photographed the whole affected area. Targa worked the rest of that day to stop the leak. I was notified late that afternoon that they had stopped the leak and that the incident was not a reportable event. Targa’s representative also ensured me that the liquids that spilled from the pipeline were nothing more than water-based corrosion inhibitors and biocide. It rained over 1” in the late afternoon, and I was told by Targa that they would have to wait until it dried up the following week to begin remediation. In the following days I learned that this pipeline is an 18” line that was installed in the 1940’s operating on a lease that was created in 1929. This line is reduced down to a 14” line further upstream that prevents them from clearing the line with traditional methods of any fluids that condensate during the natural gas transmission. Due to the lower elevation of my property these fluids collect heavily in the section of pipeline inside of my property. I decided after speaking with my legal counsel that it was best that we reach out to the Texas Railroad Commission to help ensure that the whole situation is handled properly. Remediation began around the 27th of July. They first decided that the spill had only saturated the ground a couple of inches. They removed about 6” of topsoil in the first couple of days of work. I found upon inspection that the fluid had in fact permeated deeper into the soil than they had first ascertained. I instructed Targa to continue digging. They dug down another 12”, we found more fluid that evening seeping up out of the ground in multiple areas along the length of the affected area. Targa has continued to remove soil down to almost 3 feet in areas and we are still finding oily and pungent smelling soil. We have asked that they not replace the topsoil that has been removed until we can be sure that all of the contaminated soil has been removed and they have agreed. There are a lot of very old and mature oak trees along the path of the spill, several were right in the path and that the fluid had soaked up to 8” up from the base of these trees. They sprayed the trees with some sort of degreaser and pressure washed the trunks, trying to remove the staining. It has rained over 10” since remediation started, and I fear that the situation is quickly growing out of control. I have sent samples of the soil, water wells on my property and of the fluid that had pooled on the surface on the day of the incident to the SGS Laboratory at 10165 Harwin Drive, Suite 150, Houston TX 77036 for testing and identification. I will receive the results with a fully traceable chain of custody of this testing on Friday August 6th. I am confident that the size and severity of this incident has been completely misrepresented by Targa and its representatives. Due to the misrepresentation of the incident, I am afraid that the total future environmental impact of this incident is not being fully considered. Without proper testing, monitoring and oversight there will be no way to ensure that the incident is fully remediated; that the ultimate environmental impact presently and in the future is minimized radically.",2021-10-05,Other,Potentially unreported incident.,Field,,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mW9yAAE/Inspection_Packages__r,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mW9yAAE/Inspection_Documents__r

Metcalf spoke with the complainant Mr. Greg Frazier to get clarifying information regarding the complaint. The tract of land involved with the complaint is in the process of being sold. There is believed to be a single crude oil pipeline that runs thru the land although RRC’s GIS shows two lines one a BP North America Crude line and an Enterprise crude/other transmission line depending at what point you look at. For background the complainant states that the old BP Crude line was sold to Tenneco prior to being bought by Enterprise Pipelines. This is backed up by no indications of there being a BP line on the property (no markers or cleared right away other than enterprise’s) according to the Complainant. From tracking the two lines on that run parallel and crisscross at several points until coming to a common point of origin in Limestone TX at -96.560509, 31.640913. Inspector K. Metcalf reached out to a Compliance Specialist at Enterprise to see if they can find what Enterprises records show. Depending on the results of the enterprise search will determine the course of action. 11/8/2021 at approximately 3:00PM the Enterprise Compliance Specialist replied; the enterprise pipeline is a Natural Gas transmission line in the specified area and is the only enterprise line in that area.",2021-12-15,Other,Potential duplicate pipeline in mapping.,Field,,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000miJgAAI/Inspection_Packages__r,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000miJgAAI/Inspection_Documents__r

In December 2010, Center Point took existing three inch metering equipment and replaced it with a six inch metering equipment. The initial metering equipment was very small and almost non-existent. The replacement equipment is much larger covering a large section of the pipeline right of way that is also very close to my property. My home is in a residential area, this equipment has devastated my property value and creates constant noise, seven days a week, 365 days a year, I will now have to put up a noise reduction fence because it is impossible to go outside of my home and not be negatively impacted by the constant noise, I should not have to install this type of fence and believe it is Center Point’s responsibility since it is their equipment causing the problem. I have called Center Point at least two times complaining about the noise but nothing thus far has been done. In the past when I have spoken to Center point officials, I have asked them to put up a fence for noise reduction and to hide this ugly equipment that I have to look at every time I step outside my home.

Mr. Herrick is very upset with the Railroad Commission and stated that he does not believe the Commission is doing its job properly. Mr. Herrick stated that he would contact the Commissioners and would make them aware of his concerns. Mr. Herrick told inspector Reed that there are two pipelines that cross his property and he has no problem with one of them (believed to be Energy Transfer): he has the phone number of the person in charge of the pipeline that crosses his property and he has a good relationship with that pipeline operator. When that pipeline operator is going to have some of its personnel on Mr. Herrick's property, Mr. Herrick is advised. However, he does not have a good relationship with the other operator - which is believed to be Enterprise. He has had no contact with this operator on those occasions when pipeline personnel have been on his property, and he has a concern for their physical safety. He has five dogs which he allows to have the run of the property for the protection of his livestock. He stated that the dogs could attack the pipeline personnel, and if he had been forewarned that the pipeline personnel would be on his property, then he could keep the dogs away from the pipeline personnel. Mr. Herrick is very angered by this situation and feels that he needs to bring this to the attention of the Commissioners and to express his displeasure in the way that he feels that the Commission is tending to its business.

All utilities were properly marked, except that no one knew our neighbor's gas line was running through the middle of our backyard. The workers hit that gas line when they began digging on that first day. CenterPoint Energy was called out, and they put in a temporary, above-ground gas line so that our neighbors would have gas again. Another CenterPoint worker came out again later that day to document this incident so he could report it to the Texas Railroad Commission. While I was talking to him, he assured me that this line would be rerouted in the next two to three days. That was six and a half months ago. In that amount of time, I have called and emailed CenterPoint at least a half dozen times. They never respond to the emails, and the customer service reps assure me when I speak to them that they are logging a ticket and someone will call me in two to three days to set up a time for workers to reroute the line. I still have not been put on the schedule to get this issue fixed. There is still an above-ground gas line in my backyard. It is a major safety issue and tripping hazard for my family and me, and now that we have a pool, we would like to have people over, but we don't want them to have to worry about tripping over the gas line in our yard. My address is 608 Spring Forest Dr., Conroe, TX, 77302. I would appreciate any help you could provide in getting this matter resolved in a more timely manner than CenterPoint seems to be able to.

I live in Georgetown Texas in a home in the historic district. We love our town and our home, but in recent months our gas provider, Atmos Energy, has had some major issues with gas leaks on our city?s west side. There has been a major failure of preventative maintenance but the question is, is that within their realm of responsibility? Or is that the state of Texas? responsibly? Businesses are currently going out of business and people have been evacuated from their homes for almost a month with no end in sight. In a related matter, we bought our home six years ago and utilized a state licensed inspector. He assured us that our home was safe, particularly the gas service; the concern mainly being that there was an old radiator line under our pier & beam home. In January of 2017 there was a pipe blackwater overflow in our kitchen which destroyed our floor. We had a plumber fully assess our situation and he found that THAT old radiator line was leaking in 7 areas. We had lived under false security with our two children for 4 years! It was a danger to us and to our immediate neighbors and by the grace of God we were not hurt. My greatest concern is that natural gas is is being treated like a harmless threat as if it were a pipe that leaks water, no big deal. We as Texans should take this issue much more seriously. There should be regulations that ensure that I am not buying a house that could potentially kill my family; that when I purchase a building for my business I know the gas lines are safe in the general area so my business isn?t threatened.

The valve on Energy Transfer is still open to Colt Midstream. On the Colt Midstream side they have closed the valve and locked it and purged the line. About 50 yards from this closed valve they removed a bypass line and valve so the line is completely disconnected and cannot push any gas through to Gibtown and the 2 inch line tie in to 1063 north west of Perrin.

""There is a drainage ditch that goes through my yard that has been eroding tremendously. This drainage also goes across a gas pipeline that is directly across the fence from my property. I have no doubt that it is also washing out the soil around the pipeline as well. There have been attempts to curtail the erosion. When I initially obtained the property, there were large rocks that had been put near the fence in the ditch. These rocks have now washed down the ditch and onto my property. The erosion has also cut further into the ditch and deeper under where the fence should be. We could mow across it before. Now, because of the large rocks and the cut into the bottom of the ditch, it can no longer be mowed. There is also a barbed wire fence separating the properties. The posts have washed out tremendously and it is now washing out my yard as well as the fence. The side of the drainage ditch to my yard is being cut into more and more with each rain. My next door neighbor contacted the representative for the pipeline earlier in the year because our yards were being flooded. Dirt was mounded by her fence to prevent flooding her yard. However, this has diverted the drainage to rush up the side and wash out around my fence and property even more. I left a message on June 5 for the contact given to me by my neighbor but have not received a response. That was Chris Coleman with Enlink 214-674-0130. I would like to request this matter be taken care of by an engineer rather than the quick fixes that have only led to more problems.

But in case you did not I am attaching my comments with attachments. I will also attach my proposed rules for noise control at Oil and Gas Facilities (Atch 3). The current EPA rules for noise dated 1974 do not address Low Frequency Noise (LFN) that harms the human body systems. Each of our human body systems operate at a different low frequency. When the intensity (in decibels on the ""C"" - environmental scale) exceeds a body system's operating limits, that system is compromised. Some of the comments concerning testing at the facility site came from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules. Two attachments I could not find to attach. My home address is 609 East F.M. 489, Buffalo, Texas 75831. Even though the address is Buffalo, I live 10 miles north in the community of Lanely at the corner of F.M. 489 and County Road 441. The nearest large gas compressor station is the Dowdy Ranch Compressor Station on County Road 421 about 1/2 mile further east on F.M. 489 and turn north going 1/2 mile to the entrance of the compressor station. As the crow flies, it is 0.9 miles from my home. I have found that the Low Frequency Noise (LFN) generated at this site will travel five to eight miles in all directions. Today, the LFN intensity at my home was 75 dBC (Environmental Scale). The 1974 Environmental Protection Agency limit is 55 dBA (Hearing Range Scale). For every three decibel increase, the intensity is doubled. My Blood Pressure was 194/112. My normal BP is 120/70 when the LFN is not present. I took medication and departed immediately for a public place in Buffalo. This scenario occurs almost every day. If you can get the owner (Lone Star Gas) to limit their emissions of LFN, that would be great.",,,,2018-04-11,Other,Noise complaint,Field,,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mP6dAAE/Inspection_Packages__r,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mP6dAAE/Inspection_Documents__r

(See Update Notes),"On October 1, 2020, Mr. Pete DeRobertis, RRC of Texas, contacted the complainant, Mr. Felipe Saucedo, regarding his complaint. Mr. Saucedo described the issues he saw with the installation of the pipeline on Klein Street in New Braunfels and said he had some documentation to provide. Mr. DeRobertis agreed to meet Mr. Saucedo in San Marcos on October 1 to have a face to face discussion. The investigation is ongoing. Mr. DeRobertis, RRC of Texas, has made two visits, with an appointment, to Mr. Saucedo in San Marcos, Texas on 1 October and on 8 October. In both cases, Mr. Saucedo failed to show. Mr. Saucedo answers the phone number given in the complaint only on Friday morning. Mr. Saucedo has been called multiple times on each weekday from 9/28 to 10/8.

Mr. Saucedo has never returned my calls. Mr. DeRobertis does not plan to make another visit with Mr. Saucedo but will attempt to get the relevant information by phone. The next visit will be when the pipeline in question has been identified and can be inspected. The investigation is ongoing. Update 10/20/2021: Mr. DeRobertis, Field Inspector, RRC of Texas, has made repeated attempts (dozens of times) to contact the complainant, Mr. Saucedo, by phone. Mr. Saucedo has only answered the phone twice, and both times Mr. Saucedo agreed to meet Mr. DeRobertis at his apartment in San Marcos. Both times Mr. Saucedo failed to show and Mr. Saucedo would not answer the phone nor open his door (assuming he was there). Mr. Saucedo has my number, obviously, and I recognize his number immediately. Mr. Saucedo has never called me back. I think the RRC can reasonably assume that Mr. Saucedo no longer desires the assistance of the Commission.

My father, Lester Weise, owns 89 acres in Yorktown, TX, 78164. It is called Green No. 1. Kinder Morgan, the company that ran pipeline through my father's property, have been seriously failing to maintain their right-of-ways for the past couple years. We have two bigger huisache trees that grew by the fence, on top of the pipeline. They never got removed, or sprayed, now, they have both fallen and busted our barbed wire fence. We have over 20 head of cattle fenced in, and this failure to maintain caused our cattle to cross over onto our neighbors property, and vice versa, along with them getting onto the oilfield access lease road coming onto our property. There is also a large washout further up the pipeline on our property, along side our driveway that can easily total a small car out. The company is also supposed to keep their right-of-way cut and accessible to thru traffic. They only bring an eight foot box blade and only do one pass, down the right-of-way. This year, my 66 year old father left their right-of-way uncut. They told him in May that they would have a cutter out here early July, before the 10th. As of August 16, 2019, there is still an uncut pipeline right-of-way. Kinder Morgan has been notified about all of these issues, every year for the past three years, and they never resolved them, or returned our calls. It is becoming highly ridiculous. We have attempted to contact Kinder Morgan multiple times, almost every day, since July 12th. No response has been given to us, and our issues still stand. I decided to contact the RRC in hopes that something will be done about all of this. Thank you for your time and patience. It is greatly appreciated. Also, I will be sending photos to show the damage done to our fence, and the washout in a separate email, due to size limits.

We have over 20 head of cattle fenced in, and this failure to maintain caused our cattle to cross over onto our neighbors property, and vice versa, along with them getting onto the oilfield access lease road coming onto our property. There is also a large washout further up the pipeline on our property, along side our driveway that can easily total a small car out. The company is also supposed to keep their right-of-way cut and accessible to thru traffic. They only bring an eight foot box blade and only do one pass, down the right-of-way. This year, my 66 year old father left their right-of-way uncut. They told him in May that they would have a cutter out here early July, before the 10th.

The pipeline was installed and the company used a dozer to remove my gravel from my road and spread it out over the construction area. I have tried to reach out for assistance from the company but was unable to contact or have anyone return my request. With the resent heavy rains the problem has increased to a dangerous level. I contacted the company which is now midcoast energy about the problem. I spoke with Carl about the problem and he said he would send a representative to check the property.

I am writing this letter because I read the news article in the Austin American Statesman dated 2/4/12 regarding the gas leak explosion on Payne Avenue in Austin Texas. The news article was by Patrick George and located on the front page. I am greatly concerned for my family’s safety now because a gals leak was reported at my home twice in January 2012. (January 11th and January 20th) The news article referenced above specifically stated that the explosion wasn’t caused by a reported gas leak and that the explosion “was caused by a natural gas leak from a pipe running along the street.” Well, the problem with the gas leak at our home appeared to be coming from the sidewalk in front of our home. Will we be notified if there is a gas leak from the pipe running along the street? Is anyone going to check the integrity of the pipeline in our area? How can we get a copy of the report results from the January 11th and January 20th investigation by the Texas Gas Service technicians? We have live in this home since 1966. I have no idea when the pipeline was installed, but I would I would think that the age is comparable to the 1950 installation on Payne Avenue. Your immediate attention and response to this urgent matter is greatly appreciated.",,,,2012-06-01,Gas Leak,GAS LEAK,Field,FIELD,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mOz5AAE/Inspection_Packages__r,https://rrctx.force.com/s/ietrs-complaint/related/a0ct0000000mOz5AAE/Inspection_Documents__r

About 2 months ago we had a massive pipeline leak on the back of my ranch resulting myself being taken by ambulance to the hospital for exposure of what we do not know. I was ill for almost a month, fearing it had re injured my quadruple bypass from several years ago. The night of the leak when I called Enbridge, they barely responded, I had to call 911. Enbridge never told me any emergency procedures, they could care less, 911 was in disbelief, the call is on record. Shortly there after I get one text message from them indicating they want to replace the line. I respond immediately telling them I have an environmental engineer looking at all the damage and toxic soil from there several leaks and they cannot come on until I know how much damage they have caused. In the meantime 9 of my heritage breed red Wattle Hogs die for reasons I believe are from the exposure of several gas leaks. I have parts of my crops that are not growing because of the leaks, my land is becoming a toxic hazard from Enbridge. I do not hear from them since I asked them to wait for my damage report. Two weeks ago they serve me with a restraining order, the following day they are cutting down my 10 foot high game proof fence installing gates and coming on with bulldozers, excavators, portapottys, dump trucks chain saws etc. They are destroying 10 years of my blood sweat and tears, my land is destroyed. I have had hunters scheduled to come down, they cancelled, they will not come back. The hunters were looking to spend upwards of $30,000 per day for over a week, lost revenue of over 200,000$. My exotic animals are all stressed, there will be mortality from this, there breeding will be greatly affected. They will be here for a month destroying my quality of life and all Texas represents.

Our South fence line is just behind the conservation lake which is now completely dry. I know that Petrolia has wells and pipelines running across the property. However, we have gotten no payment in a year or two. I don't think any of the lines are buried, because very large black PVC pipe crosses the property openly. We have to drive over them, which is a pain. I know there is one or two gas wells in the West portion. There is a now dry pond behind the old cabin North of the lake and two dry ponds straight East of the lake. I don't know if that is the blue circles with a 1 and 1A by them. There is an abandoned gypy water well (but I remember cows drinking it in the drought) just about straight East of the Lake as well. However, we are planning to build a retirement home just West of the lake (about half way to the road). There old cabin on the North end of the lake that was served by Lone Star Gas (now Atmos). There has been no use of the cabin for 40 years due to it being flooded 2 or 3 times. My family has owned this property for well over 60 years & we have inherited it. No one will own up to the old Lone Star Gas meter/regulator just to the West of the North end of the lake area that served the cabin. Atmos says they sold the lines and every phone number I have been given gives me another number to call and no one seems to know anything about it. We need to run a water line to stock pens that have been present for over 62 years (every since I can remember) and to the location just to the South East of those stock pens where we want to build a house.

I have contacted Magellan about this leak, as their company sends out pipeline fliers, in regards to the procedures for reporting possible leaks.Twice they have halted their transportation to investigate the possible leak and found nothing from their pipeline. However, I have been told that there are multiple companies running pipes out here. They suggested I call the Sheriff?s Office, but I am not sure if that is the correct procedure. I have since that time not only smelt petroleum but also natural gas or sulfur; leading me to be even more concerned about pipeline leakage from pipes near our homes. There are many aquifers around here, and also many people around this community draw off of well water for their drinking sources. I am concerned that there may be a leak out here and that it is going unnoticed and creating a potential ecological disaster.I have lived out here for 16 and a half years, and this has only been occurring over the last two years or so.

Chenney is concerned about the safety of a pipeline that crosses his property. He states that the company that owns it, DCP Midstream, installed an inaccessible shut-off valve. He says his driveway was used when it was installed five years ago, but a temporary wooden bridge to cross the river had to be built to install the shut-off valve. The bridge no longer exists, and no road leads to the shut-off valve. Mr. Chenney spoke with the electrical company and they expressed concern that if they accidentally damaged the pipeline, they would not be able to access the shut-off valve. Chenney says that the company has a permit with TxDOT to build a road to the site but has never done so. He says the area is inaccessible from the road with shrubbery and a ditch that can’t be driven through in the way. He believes it is an accident waiting to happen.","Discussed with DCP NGL OPERATING, LLC records and maps demonstrating compliance.

Mr. Chenney discussed concerns with a valve located on his property and the valve not being accessible to reach. He explained he talked with a TXDOT representative and stated the valve location must be accessible for utility companies to shut off in case of emergency. Mr. Chenney explained operator DCP Midstream holds a permit to put a driveway on his property at the complainant’s location but never did complete. Inspector Damron explained to Mr. Chenney that there could be valves installed and located upstream and downstream of complainant valve location. She explained typically the upstream valve can be used to shut in line in case of emergency. Inspector Damron explained operators are required to have valves located per 49 CFR 195.260. Inspector Damron explained to him she will contact the operator and ask what valves are located upstream of complainant locations and ask if the valve is accessible. She explained to Mr. Chenney the Railroad Commission of Texas does not have jurisdiction over verifying any status on TXDOT driveway permits, nor does the RRC handle civil matters regarding driveways or disputes between the landowner and operator. On August 17, 2021 Railroad Commission of Texas Inspector Macey Damron made contact with operator of DCP Midstream Mr. Michael Land at 4:19 p.m. discussing the concerns from landowner. Mr. Land explained DCP has a valve (MLV2) located north approximately four miles upstream of landowner’s property valve (MLV3) location and can be used to isolate the line downstream. The (MLV3) located on landowners property is north of Brushy Creek and (MLV2) can isolate downstream segment prior to creek crossing. Mr. Land explained he understands Mr. Chenneys concerns and will contact him to discuss. On August 19, 2021 at 1:22 p.m. RRC Inspector Macey Damron made contact with landowner providing him a update operator has access to both (MLV2) and (MLV3). Mr. Chenney was not satisfied with response and requested operator to demonstrate how they receive access. RRC Inspector explained to Mr. Chenney she will gather operators valve inspection report records required under 49 CFR 195.420 and follow up. On August 19, 2021 at 1:22 p.m. RRC Inspector Macey Damron made contact with operator requesting maps and valve maintenance records required under 195.420. DCP provided requested documents via email. On August 24, 2021 at 8:31 a.m. RRC Inspector Damron made contact with landowner discussing her conclusion to complaint. DCP provided (MLBV2 and MLBV3) DOT valve liquid inspection reports for March 5, 2021 meeting the 49 CFR 195.420 requirement.

There is a pipeline in RRC mapping that belongs to Arrowhead Productions LP on T-4 permit 07684 that was just recently Unrevoked.,See Update Notes.,See Update Notes.,Inspector Gary Cummings made contact with Sherlene Nelson on 10/19/21 to get more information on the complaint. Inspector Cummings contacted Steven Moore at Arrowhead Production LP on 10/19/21 to get more information from the operator. Mr. Moore stated there was a pin hole in a riser of a water release line and that the riser was replaced. He also mentioned they were waiting for it to dry up a bit to clean the affected soil around the leak. The complainant stated on my call with her that they covered it with something instead of replacing the riser. On 10/20/21 inspector Cummings went to the site and met with the complainant to see what was accomplished. He observed that an aluminum sleeve was installed and tightened to prevent the riser from continuing to leak. Inspector Cummings contacted Mr. Moore and he said he misspoke and that by next Wednesday 10/27/21 they will have a Poly riser installed. Inspector Cummings is requesting completed pictures and system pressure information to see if a poly riser is the right material to withstand current pressure of this line. He will follow up with Mr. Moore on 10/27/21 for pictures and system information to verify the repair is completed. Update: 10/29/2021 - Inspector Cummings called several times and left messages to get a status on repaired pipe. Awaiting response. Update 11/2/2021 - Inspector Cummings got ahold of Mr. Moore and he needed to contact another member to get the status on the repair. He spoke with Sharlene the land owner and she said nothing has been done as of this last weekend. Waiting for Mr. Moore response. Update: 11/4/2021 - Inspector Cummings continues to try and reach Mr. Moore for an update. As of now the leak has a clamp on it and it may be more beneficial for the Oil and Gas Division to complete an inspection on the salt water line that had the leak.

Chad explained that they have no fence there that they don?t even have a gate there and if it was their fence they would take it down because they don?t want a fence there. They instructed Mr. Speck of this which is when he decided to contact the state, at which point the call was transferred to me.
